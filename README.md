# TimlinePictureAndroidApp
Our repository for our Android project at school.

Our project was created to help people to make timeline photos.
Timeline photos are photos that are taken at same place but different time, like one in summer and second in winter.

Our application will take the photo then you can name it and give it some information and then it vill be saved with timestamp.
When you come back to same place you have oppurtunity to take an update photo witch will show ghost image from previous photo to make it more accurate.
Other feature is you can open included googlemaps and see where you have been taken photos.

Last feature is Viewing the photos.
